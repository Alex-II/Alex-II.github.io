# [Core Design Principles for Software Developers by Venkat Subramaniam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llGgO74uXMI)

## Good Design
A good design is a design that's easy to change
Correct solution takes iterations, constantly in evolution

Writing code first time is an exploration: many relationships are discovered, questions asked and answered.
When we're done, we should (utopically) delete it and rewrite it; rewriting will be much faster and we will rewrite with many lessons learned from first attempt.
