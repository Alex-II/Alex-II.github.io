# ["One Log" by Arnaud Bailly & Yann Schwartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKtCsODXjbw)

- Applications have input/output, the functional plane
- Also have runtime controls and **accidental outputs**, the operational plane
  - accidental output is logs, tracing, monitoring
  - [naming seems misleading, I'd prefer **operational output**]

## Shaping the Log
- Make the accidental output:
  - no longer an afterthought
  - useful, available

- Log schema:
  - Each log is an event, all output should conform to a schema that describes the event
  - don't string interpolate, use type/value pairs

- Structured log:
  - log events are parsable, can be filtered, categorized

- Collect infra info
  - e.g. query the container, infra, OS info
  
- Centralize info in one log location:
  - application + infra same place

- Log a lot, view using tools instead of raw text
  
## Log as a Language
[Nomenclature is confusing and the metaphor so far]

### Words
- each event/log is considered a word
- we can group events/words
  - certain events are similar enough in their nature to be considered in the same group; some details will defer 
  - e.g. events showing backup was performed: we ignore the size, timestamp, we just care this grouping is about the backup being performed successfully 
  - e.g. events showing a specific RPC failed: we ignore the exact IP, we just care this grouping is about a specific RPC failing
- we can count events/words 
  - e.g. how many events/words are in groups?
  - we can consider monitoring based on this

### Grammar (Relation Between Words)
- We can derive system behavior by looking at sequence of words/events
- Accidental output (e.g. structured logs) can be fed into decision-making parts of the program
  - e.g. implement circuit breaker pattern based on the frequency of RPC-failed messages within a time span
  - i.e. accidental output of component 1 become functional input of component 2

## NLP on Logs
- Apply NLP on logs
- Detect relationship between words using Log2Vec
  - e.g. high CPU word can correlate with a failure word somewhere else
